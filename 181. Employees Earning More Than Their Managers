# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT e.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e
INNER JOIN Employee m ON e.managerId = m.id
WHERE m.salary < e.salary

# Since we have one table, use the same table but connecting managers on id, with their employees. 
#Then compare the salaries. Also making sure that the output is employees.name
